## SECTION 5: DESCRIPTION OF DISCRIMINATORY ACTS

### WHAT HAPPENED (Use this text for the complaint narrative):

---

**SUMMARY:**
We are tenants of 5+ years at Lexington Flats with a PERFECT rental history - zero lease violations, rent paid on time every month, and management previously stated our unit was "kept very well." After we complained about accounting errors and harassment by a new property manager, Velair Property Management retaliated by fabricating lease violations and attempting to evict us.

**TIMELINE OF RETALIATORY ACTS:**

**August 13, 2025:** Velair OFFERED us a lease renewal, confirming we were tenants in good standing.

**August 17, 2025:** Our apartment unit #104 was listed for rent on RENTCafe.com - this was BEFORE any alleged lease violation. This proves the decision to remove us was made before any misconduct was alleged.

**August 18, 2025:** ONE DAY after listing our unit for rent, Velair issued a "Serious Lease Infraction" notice against co-tenant Dena Sazama, alleging she was "verbally abusive" to staff. NO documentation, police reports, or witness statements were provided. The notice demanded we agree to "mutual termination" within 7 days or face eviction.

**August 30, 2025:** We signed the lease renewal. Velair asked us to BACKDATE the lease - an irregular practice.

**September 3, 2025:** I (Bradley Crowe) sent a formal Cease & Desist letter to Velair corporate citing harassment by the new property manager Lisa Burg.

**September 4, 2025:** Velair responded by directing us to their attorney and threatening eviction - this was in direct response to our protected complaint.

**September 4, 2025:** I filed a formal complaint with the Minnesota Attorney General's Office regarding Velair's conduct.

**September 19, 2025:** Regional Property Manager Jodelle Rossi sent an email making FALSE and DEFAMATORY statements, claiming I had "interacted with Velair staff in a belligerent manner while appearing to be under the influence." These accusations are completely fabricated:
- No incident reports exist
- No police reports were filed
- No lease violation notices were issued to me prior to this
- After 5 years of tenancy, there was never any allegation of substance use

**September 20, 2025:** I sent a Final Notice Before Legal Action citing Minnesota retaliation statutes (MN § 504B.285, § 504B.441).

**EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION:**
The most critical evidence is that our apartment was listed for rent on August 17, 2025 - ONE FULL DAY BEFORE the alleged lease violation on August 18, 2025. This proves Velair decided to remove us BEFORE any alleged misconduct occurred. The "lease violation" was fabricated as a pretext.

**PATTERN OF RETALIATION:**
Every negative action by Velair occurred AFTER we engaged in protected activities:
1. After we complained about accounting errors → Fabricated violation issued
2. After we sent Cease & Desist → Directed to attorney, eviction threatened
3. After we filed AG complaint → Defamatory statements made
4. After we demanded documentation → Refused to provide evidence
