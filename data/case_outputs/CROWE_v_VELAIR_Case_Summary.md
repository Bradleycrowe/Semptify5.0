## 🔥 KEY EVIDENCE POINTS

### Evidence of Retaliation Timeline
1. **Aug 13, 2025** - Velair offers lease renewal ✓
2. **Aug 17, 2025** - Unit #104 listed on RENTCafe (BEFORE alleged violation!)
3. **Aug 18, 2025** - Velair issues "Serious Lease Infraction" notice to Dena

### Smoking Gun Evidence
> **Unit was listed for rent on Aug 17, 2025 - ONE DAY BEFORE the alleged lease violation on Aug 18, 2025**
> 
> This proves the decision to remove tenants was made BEFORE any alleged infraction occurred.

### Fabricated Violation Analysis
The Aug 18, 2025 "Serious Lease Infraction" notice alleges:
- "Verbally abusive to on-call maintenance and property maintenance staff"
- Cites multiple MN statutes (504B.171, 504B.321)
- **NO documentation, witness statements, or police reports provided**
- Issued to Dena Sazama only (not Bradley)
- Demands "mutual termination" within 7 days or eviction

### Landlord's False Accusations (Documented)
From Jodelle Rossi's Sep 19, 2025 email:
> "Unfortunately, there have been multiple incidents in which Bradley has interacted with Velair staff in a **belligerent manner** while appearing to be **under the influence**."

**Tenant's Counter:**
- No incident reports provided
- No police reports provided
- No lease violation notices for Bradley prior to this
- 5 years of tenancy with zero infractions
