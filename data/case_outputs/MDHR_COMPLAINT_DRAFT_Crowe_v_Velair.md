## DETAILED NARRATIVE

*(Copy and paste this section into the MDHR online form)*

---

**INTRODUCTION:**

We are filing this complaint against Velair Property Management, LLC for retaliating against us after we engaged in protected activities under Minnesota law. We have been tenants at Lexington Flats for over 4 years with a perfect rental history—zero lease violations and rent paid on time every month. After we complained about accounting errors and harassment by the new property manager, Velair fabricated lease violations and initiated eviction proceedings against us.

**THE CRITICAL EVIDENCE:**

Our apartment (Unit #104) was listed for rent on RENTCafe.com on **August 17, 2025**—a full day BEFORE any alleged lease violation occurred on August 18, 2025. This proves Velair decided to remove us from our home before any misconduct was alleged. The "lease violation" was manufactured as a pretext for eviction.

**CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE:**

**August 13, 2025:** Velair offered us a lease renewal, confirming we were tenants in good standing with no issues.

**August 17, 2025:** Our unit was listed for rent on RENTCafe.com. We discovered this listing later and preserved screenshots as evidence.

**August 18, 2025:** One day after listing our unit, Velair issued a "Serious Lease Infraction" notice against co-tenant Dena Sazama. The notice alleged she was "verbally abusive" to staff but provided:
- No incident report
- No witness statements
- No police report
- No documentation whatsoever

The notice demanded we agree to "mutual termination" within 7 days or face eviction.

**August 30, 2025:** Despite the threat, we signed the lease renewal as offered. Velair staff asked us to BACKDATE the lease—an irregular and potentially unlawful practice.

**September 3, 2025:** I (Bradley Crowe) sent a formal Cease & Desist letter to Velair's corporate office documenting harassment by onsite manager Lisa Burg. This is a protected activity under Minnesota law.

**September 4, 2025:** Instead of addressing our concerns, Velair responded by directing us to their attorney and threatening eviction. This response came in direct retaliation for our protected complaint.

**September 4, 2025:** I filed a formal complaint with the Minnesota Attorney General's Office regarding Velair's conduct.

**September 19, 2025:** Regional Property Manager Jodelle Rossi sent an email containing false and defamatory statements, claiming I had "interacted with Velair staff in a belligerent manner while appearing to be under the influence." This accusation is completely fabricated:
- No incident reports document any such behavior
- No police were ever called
- No lease violation was ever issued to me for this
- In 4+ years of tenancy, there was never any allegation of substance use
- This statement was made to harm my reputation and justify eviction

**September 20, 2025:** I sent a Final Notice Before Legal Action to Velair citing Minnesota retaliation statutes (Minn. Stat. § 504B.285 and § 504B.441).

**PATTERN OF RETALIATION:**

Every adverse action by Velair occurred AFTER we engaged in protected activity:

| Protected Activity | Velair's Retaliatory Response |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Complained about accounting errors | Fabricated lease violation issued |
| Sent Cease & Desist letter | Directed to attorney, eviction threatened |
| Filed Attorney General complaint | Defamatory statements made |
| Demanded documentation | Refused to provide any evidence |

**ONGOING HARM:**

We now face eviction proceedings (Dakota County Case #19AV-CV-25-3477) based entirely on fabricated allegations. We have lived in our home for over 4 years without a single legitimate complaint. We pay rent on time every month. Management previously praised how well we kept our unit.

We are being forced from our home as punishment for exercising our legal rights.
