## IN SUPPORT OF BRADLEY A. CROWE & DENA SAZAMA
### Against Velair Property Management, LLC

---

## 📋 DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document provides point-by-point rebuttals to Velair Property Management's allegations and a comprehensive counter-argument establishing landlord retaliation under Minnesota law.

---

## PART I: REBUTTAL TO LANDLORD'S ALLEGATIONS

---

### 🔴 ALLEGATION #1: "Belligerent Behavior"

**Landlord's Claim (Jodelle Rossi, Sep 19, 2025):**
> "There have been multiple incidents in which Bradley has interacted with Velair staff in a belligerent manner."

**REBUTTAL:**

1. **No Documentation Provided**
   - Despite repeated written requests (Sep 19, Sep 20, 2025), Velair has failed to produce ANY documentation of these alleged "multiple incidents"
   - No incident reports
   - No witness statements
   - No dates, times, or specific allegations
   
2. **5-Year Clean Record**
   - Bradley Crowe has been a tenant since November 21, 2021
   - ZERO documented lease violations in 5 years
   - This claim conveniently arises only AFTER tenant asserted legal rights
   
3. **Vague & Conclusory Language**
   - "Belligerent manner" is subjective and undefined
   - Provides no specific acts that constitute a lease violation
   - Fails to identify which lease provision was allegedly violated

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT:**
Under Minnesota law, landlords must provide specific, documented grounds for adverse actions. Vague characterizations without supporting evidence are insufficient and suggest pretextual reasoning for retaliation.

---

### 🔴 ALLEGATION #2: "Appearing Under the Influence"

**Landlord's Claim (Jodelle Rossi, Sep 19, 2025):**
> "Bradley has interacted with Velair staff... while appearing to be under the influence."

**REBUTTAL:**

1. **Defamatory Per Se**
   - Falsely accusing someone of substance abuse in a professional/housing context constitutes defamation per se under Minnesota law
   - No evidence provided (blood test, police report, medical documentation)
   
2. **No Police Report**
   - Even when Lisa Burg called police, NO police report exists documenting intoxication
   - If tenant was truly "under the influence," law enforcement would have documented it
   
3. **Pattern of False Accusations**
   - This accusation appeared ONLY after tenant filed Cease & Desist
   - Never mentioned in prior 5 years of tenancy
   - Timing proves retaliatory motive

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT:**
Making unsubstantiated accusations of intoxication is:
- Potentially defamatory
- Evidence of bad faith
- Retaliatory in timing
- Designed to create false justification for eviction

---

### 🔴 ALLEGATION #3: "Serious Lease Infraction" (Aug 18, 2025)

**Landlord's Claim:**
> Dena Sazama committed a "Serious Lease Infraction" for being "verbally abusive to on-call maintenance and property maintenance staff."

**REBUTTAL:**

1. **No Witness Statements**
   - No signed statements from maintenance staff
   - No audio/video recordings
   - No contemporaneous documentation
   
2. **Contradictory Timeline**
   - Unit #104 was listed on RENTCafe on **August 17, 2025**
   - Alleged violation occurred on **August 18, 2025**
   - **Decision to remove tenants preceded the alleged violation**
   
3. **Selective Enforcement**
   - Notice issued ONLY to Dena Sazama
   - Bradley Crowe not named despite being co-tenant
   - Suggests targeting of vulnerable tenant (Dena has documented anxiety)
   
4. **Procedural Violations**
   - No opportunity to cure the alleged violation
   - No prior warning about the alleged behavior
   - Demanded termination within 7 days or eviction

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT:**
The lease infraction notice is demonstrably pretextual because the landlord listed the unit for rent ONE DAY BEFORE the alleged infraction. This proves the landlord intended to remove tenants regardless of any violation.

---

### 🔴 ALLEGATION #4: "Law Enforcement Was Called"

**Landlord's Claim (Jodelle Rossi, Sep 4, 2025):**
> "When law enforcement is called to the property due to your actions toward our staff, this is considered a serious violation."

**REBUTTAL:**

1. **Landlord Initiated Police Contact**
   - Lisa Burg called police, NOT the tenants
   - Police were called during tenant's "peaceful inquiry"
   - No arrest was made
   - No charges were filed
   
2. **Police Response ≠ Tenant Misconduct**
   - A landlord calling police does not prove tenant wrongdoing
   - Weaponizing law enforcement against tenants is itself a form of harassment
   - Common retaliation tactic to create paper trail
   
3. **Tenant Was Exercising Rights**
   - Tenant was attempting to discuss allegations face-to-face
   - Landlord slammed door and called police
   - This is NOT criminal or lease-violating behavior

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT:**
Calling police on a tenant who is peacefully attempting to discuss lease matters is:
- An abuse of emergency services
- Evidence of intent to harass/intimidate
- NOT evidence of tenant misconduct

---

## PART II: AFFIRMATIVE CASE FOR RETALIATION

---

### ⚖️ MINNESOTA RETALIATION LAW

**Minnesota Statute § 504B.285 - Retaliatory Eviction**
> A landlord cannot evict a tenant as retaliation for the tenant's good faith complaint to a governmental authority or for asserting legal rights under the lease or Minnesota law.

**Minnesota Statute § 504B.441 - Tenant Retaliation**
> Prohibits landlords from retaliating against tenants who assert their legal rights.

---

### 📋 ELEMENTS OF RETALIATION (ESTABLISHED)

#### Element 1: Protected Activity ✅
**Tenant engaged in protected conduct:**
- Sep 3, 2025: Sent Cease & Desist letter citing harassment
- Sep 4, 2025: Filed complaint with Minnesota Attorney General
- Sep 19, 2025: Formally asserted rights under MN § 504B.285 and § 504B.441
- Sep 20, 2025: Issued Final Notice Before Legal Action

#### Element 2: Adverse Action ✅
**Landlord took adverse action:**
- Sep 4, 2025: Announced "eviction for cause" (within 24 hours of C&D)
- Sep 4, 2025: Cut off direct communication ("directed to attorney")
- Sep 19, 2025: Refused to provide documentation
- Sep 19, 2025: Made defamatory statements
- Ongoing: Refused to engage in good faith

#### Element 3: Causal Connection ✅
**Clear temporal proximity:**
| Protected Activity | Adverse Action | Time Gap |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| Cease & Desist (Sep 3) | Eviction announced | **< 24 hours** |
| AG Complaint (Sep 4) | Communications cut | **Same day** |
| Rights assertion (Sep 19) | Defamatory response | **Same day** |

#### Element 4: Pretext Established ✅
**Landlord's stated reasons are pretextual:**
- Unit listed for rent BEFORE alleged violation
- No documentation of alleged incidents
- 5 years of clean tenancy record
- Timing coincides with tenant rights assertion

### 🚨 THE SMOKING GUN: PRE-PLANNED EVICTION

**The single most compelling evidence of retaliation:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   AUGUST 17, 2025: Unit #104 listed on RENTCafe            │
│                           ↓                                 │
│   AUGUST 18, 2025: "Serious Lease Infraction" issued       │
│                                                             │
│   THE UNIT WAS LISTED FOR RENT ONE DAY BEFORE THE          │
│   ALLEGED VIOLATION THAT SUPPOSEDLY JUSTIFIED REMOVAL!     │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This proves:
1. Velair had already decided to remove tenants
2. The lease infraction was fabricated post-hoc
3. The stated reason for non-renewal is pretextual
4. The landlord's narrative is fundamentally dishonest

---

### 📝 PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS

1. **Immediate cessation** of all adverse actions
2. **Withdrawal** of lease violation notice and non-renewal
3. **Written apology** for defamatory statements
4. **Payment** of compensatory damages (to be calculated)
5. **Lease renewal** on standard terms
6. **Commitment** to follow proper procedures going forward

---

## PART IV: RESPONSE TO ANTICIPATED DEFENSES

---

### Defense: "We have the right to non-renew any lease"

**COUNTER:**
While landlords generally have discretion over lease renewals, this discretion is LIMITED by anti-retaliation statutes. When non-renewal is motivated by tenant's protected activities, it constitutes illegal retaliation regardless of landlord's general renewal rights.

---

### Defense: "Tenant was disruptive/unprofessional"

**COUNTER:**
- Provide the documentation. You have none.
- Explain why unit was listed BEFORE alleged disruption.
- Explain why this tenant had zero issues for 5 years.
- Address the timing coincidence with tenant's legal actions.

---

### Defense: "We followed proper procedures"

**COUNTER:**
- You required backdating of the lease (procedurally improper)
- You refused to provide documentation (bad faith)
- You made accusations without evidence (defamation)
- You called police during peaceful inquiry (harassment)
- You announced eviction within 24 hours of C&D (retaliation)

---

### Defense: "The lease infraction was legitimate"

**COUNTER:**
Then produce:
- [ ] Incident report with date, time, witness names
- [ ] Signed witness statements
- [ ] Any audio/video evidence
- [ ] Prior warnings to tenant
- [ ] Police report (if any)

**You have produced NONE of these despite multiple written requests.**

---

## CONCLUSION

The evidence overwhelmingly supports that Velair Property Management has engaged in unlawful retaliation against Bradley Crowe and Dena Sazama in violation of Minnesota Statutes § 504B.285 and § 504B.441.

The landlord's conduct demonstrates:
- ✅ Fabricated violations
- ✅ Pretextual reasoning
- ✅ Immediate retaliation after protected activity
- ✅ Refusal to provide documentation
- ✅ Defamatory accusations
- ✅ Harassment and intimidation

Tenants are entitled to relief under Minnesota law including damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.
