## NATURE OF COMPLAINT

### Issues to Report:

- [ ] **Landlord Harassment** - Management engaging in retaliatory conduct
- [ ] **Rental License Violations** - If property requires city license
- [ ] **Unfair Lease Practices** - Requesting backdated leases
- [ ] **Failure to Maintain Records** - No documentation for alleged violations
- [ ] **False Eviction Filings** - Based on fabricated claims

---

## SUMMARY OF ISSUES

We are long-term tenants (4+ years) at Lexington Flats with a perfect rental history. After we complained about accounting errors and harassment, the property management company (Velair) fabricated lease violations and is attempting to evict us from our home.

**Key Concerns for the City:**

1. **Landlord Harassment Pattern:** The property management is engaging in a pattern of harassment against tenants who exercise their legal rights.

2. **Premeditated Eviction:** Our unit was listed for rent on August 17, 2025—BEFORE any alleged lease violation (August 18, 2025). This suggests evictions may be targeting tenants illegally.

3. **Fabricated Violations:** The management issued a "Serious Lease Infraction" notice with ZERO documentation—no incident reports, no witness statements, nothing.

4. **Defamatory Conduct:** Management made false written statements accusing a tenant of being "under the influence"—a serious, documented lie.

5. **Irregular Lease Practices:** Management requested we backdate our lease renewal—a practice that may violate rental licensing requirements.
