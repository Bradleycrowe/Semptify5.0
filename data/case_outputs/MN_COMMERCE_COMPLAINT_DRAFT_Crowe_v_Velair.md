## DETAILED NARRATIVE

*(Copy this section for the complaint form)*

---

**SUMMARY:**

I am filing this complaint against Ryan Schwickert, licensed real estate broker for Velair Property Management, LLC, for failure to supervise staff and permitting dishonest, retaliatory conduct that violates Minnesota real estate licensing laws.

**BACKGROUND:**

I have been a tenant at Lexington Flats (managed by Velair) for over 4 years with a perfect rental history. After complaining about accounting errors and harassment by the new property manager, Velair fabricated lease violations and initiated eviction proceedings.

**BROKER'S FAILURES:**

As the designated broker, Ryan Schwickert is legally responsible for supervising all property management activities. The following occurred under his supervision:

1. **Fabricated Lease Violation (August 18, 2025):** Staff issued a "Serious Lease Infraction" notice claiming co-tenant Dena Sazama was "verbally abusive." NO documentation exists—no incident report, no witness statements, no police report. When we requested evidence, Velair refused to provide any.

2. **Premeditated Eviction:** Our apartment was listed for rent on August 17, 2025—ONE DAY BEFORE the alleged violation. This proves the decision to evict us was made before any misconduct was alleged.

3. **Defamatory Statements (September 19, 2025):** Regional Manager Jodelle Rossi sent an email falsely claiming I had "interacted with Velair staff in a belligerent manner while appearing to be under the influence." This is completely fabricated—no documentation supports this, and in 4+ years there was never any allegation of substance use.

4. **Lease Backdating:** Staff requested we backdate our lease renewal—an irregular practice.

5. **Retaliation:** Every adverse action occurred after we engaged in protected activities (complaining about errors, sending Cease & Desist, filing AG complaint).

**BROKER ACCOUNTABILITY:**

Under Minnesota law, Ryan Schwickert is responsible for the conduct of Velair staff. He has:
- Failed to establish adequate supervision systems
- Failed to ensure proper documentation of lease violations
- Failed to prevent retaliatory conduct
- Permitted defamatory statements to be made
- Allowed staff to request backdating of legal documents

---

## RELIEF REQUESTED

We request the Minnesota Department of Commerce:

1. **Investigate** Ryan Schwickert's supervision of Velair Property Management
2. **Discipline** Schwickert's real estate broker license (suspension, revocation, or civil penalties)
3. **Require** enhanced supervision and training for Velair staff
4. **Order** proper documentation practices for lease violations
5. **Refer** this matter to the Attorney General if criminal conduct is found
