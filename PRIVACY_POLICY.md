## Our Privacy Commitment

**Semptify does not store user logs, personal information, or track user activity.** We are designed with privacy-first architecture where your data remains under YOUR control.

### 100% Free

**Semptify is completely free to use.** There are:
- No subscription fees
- No premium tiers
- No hidden costs
- No paywalls
- No ads

**Donations are welcome** to help support development and server costs, but are never required.

### No User Registration

**Semptify has NO user registration process.** We don't ask you to:
- Create an account
- Choose a username
- Set a password
- Provide an email address
- Enter any personal details

You simply authenticate with your existing cloud storage provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive). That's it. No forms. No signups. No personal data collection.

Semptify explicitly **does not** collect or store:

- ❌ **User activity logs** - We don't track what you click, view, or do
- ❌ **IP addresses** - We don't log your IP address
- ❌ **Device fingerprints** - We don't uniquely identify your device
- ❌ **Browser history** - We don't track pages visited

## 2. Technical Information We MAY Process

For compatibility purposes only, we may process (but do not log or store):

- ✅ **Browser version** - To ensure compatibility (e.g., "Chrome 120")
- ✅ **Operating system** - To ensure compatibility (e.g., "Windows 11")
- ✅ **Screen DPI/resolution** - For proper UI rendering

**This is NOT tracked, logged, or stored.** It's only used in-memory during your session for proper application rendering.

The following information is processed temporarily during your session but **never stored in our databases**:

### 2.1 Authentication Tokens
- OAuth tokens from your cloud storage provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- These are **encrypted** using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from your user ID
- Tokens are stored **only in your browser session** and encrypted session storage
- When you log out, tokens are deleted

### 2.2 Session Identifiers
- A randomly generated user ID stored in a browser cookie (`semptify_uid`)
- This ID does **not** contain any personal information
- Used only to maintain your session during use

---

## 3. Information Stored in YOUR Cloud Storage

All persistent data is stored in **your own cloud storage account** (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive), not on Semptify servers:

- Documents you upload
- Timeline events you create
- Case information you enter
- Any evidence or records you generate

**You own this data. You control this data. You can delete this data at any time.**

---

## 4. Minimal Database Records

We store minimal functional records in our database that are **necessary for the application to work**:

### No User Registration
There is **no registration process**. No username, no password, no email forms. You authenticate directly through your cloud storage provider's OAuth system.

### What we store:
| Data | Purpose | Retention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| User ID (random string) | Session management | Until logout |
| Cloud provider name | Know which OAuth to use | Session duration |
| Encrypted access tokens | Authenticate with your cloud | Session duration only |
| User-created case data | Your eviction case records | User-controlled deletion |

### What we DON'T store:
- Your name (we never ask for it)
- Your email (OAuth only, not stored by us)
- Your address (only if you add it to legal documents YOU create)
- Your phone number
- Your password (we use OAuth - no passwords ever)
- Your browsing behavior
- Your device information
- Any registration data (there is no registration)
