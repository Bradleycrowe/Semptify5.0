            <p>
                Semptify was born from a feeling — the promise of loyalty, resilience, and "no one left behind."
            </p>

            <p>
                The name is inspired by the U.S. Marine Corps motto <em>Semper Fi</em> (Semper Fidelis), which 
                means "Always Faithful." While we honor and deeply respect the Marines' service and sacrifice, 
                Semptify adapts that spirit for a different mission: tenant justice and community empowerment.
            </p>

                Semptify was created to carry forward the spirit of loyalty and resilience — always faithful 
                to tenants, always faithful to community. It is a platform built to reassure: <em>it will be okay</em>. 
                We are here to help you with practical tools, clear suggestions, and organized flows that make 
                your situation easier to manage. Whether you are facing eviction, dealing with fraud, or simply 
                confused about your rights, Semptify gives you a way to take control, organize your case, and 
                move forward with dignity and support.

            <p>
                <strong>Always Faithful to Tenants.</strong> No one faces eviction or fraud alone. When you are 
                overwhelmed by legal documents, confusing deadlines, and powerful adversaries, Semptify stands 
                with you. We provide the tools to organize your case, understand your options, and take action. 
                You are not abandoned. You are not forgotten. You matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Always Faithful to Justice.</strong> Every feature in Semptify is built to protect rights 
                and expose wrongdoing. From documenting habitability violations to tracking illegal fees, from 
                understanding your legal defenses to organizing evidence of discrimination — these tools exist 
                because justice should not depend on whether you can afford a lawyer.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Always Faithful to Community.</strong> Housing is not just an individual issue — it is 
                a community issue. Semptify is designed for collective action, accessible to everyone regardless 
                of technical skill, and built to support not just tenants but also the organizers, advocates, 
                and neighbors who stand beside them.

            <h2 class="section-title">📓 What Semptify Actually Does</h2>

            <p>
                At its core, Semptify is a tenant's digital logbook — a place to store your lease, log your 
                rent payments, document maintenance issues, save communications with your landlord, and learn 
                about your rights as a tenant. Think of it as a personal filing cabinet for your rental life.
            </p>

            <p>
                But it is more than storage. Semptify helps you make sense of your situation. It builds timelines 
                from your documents. It suggests what steps to take next. It explains legal concepts in plain 
                language. It generates template letters when you need to communicate formally with your landlord 
                or respond to legal notices.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe that <strong>knowledge and preparation</strong> can prevent many tenant-landlord disputes 
                before they ever escalate. And if issues do arise, you will have everything organized and ready. 
                The best outcome is a peaceful tenancy where your documentation sits quietly in your cloud storage, 
                never needed. But if something goes wrong, you will not be starting from zero.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">📊 Why Documentation Matters</h2>            <p>
                According to research from Princeton University's Eviction Lab, approximately 
                <span class="stat">3.6 million eviction cases</span> are filed each year in the United States. 
                That is roughly one eviction filing for every ten renter households annually. Behind each of 
                those numbers is a person or family facing one of the most stressful experiences of their lives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Studies consistently show that the vast majority of tenants — often cited as 
                <span class="stat">90% or more</span> — appear in eviction court without legal representation. 
                Meanwhile, most landlords have attorneys. This imbalance means that many tenants lose cases not 
                because they were wrong, but because they did not know how to present their case, could not 
                find their documents, or simply did not understand the process.
                <span class="source">(Source: National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel)</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is something important to understand: in legal disputes, documentation often matters more 
                than being "right." A tenant who can produce dated photographs of mold, copies of maintenance 
                requests, and records of rent payments has a fundamentally different case than one who says 
                "I know I paid" or "I told them about the problem." Courts deal in evidence, and evidence 
                requires documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our hope — our sincere hope — is that you never need any of this. The ideal outcome is a 
                peaceful tenancy where your organized documents sit quietly in your cloud storage, never 
                needed for anything more than your own reference. But if something does go wrong, you will 
                be prepared. You will have records. You will have a timeline. You will have evidence.

            <p>
                Semptify helps you organize and store documents related to your rental — your lease agreement, 
                move-in inspection reports, rent receipts, maintenance requests, photographs of the property, 
                and communications with your landlord. It helps you build a timeline of your tenancy so you 
                can see events in chronological order. It provides educational information about tenant rights, 
                though this varies significantly by state and locality.

                The application can help you generate template letters — things like maintenance demand letters 
                or security deposit dispute letters — but these are templates, not legal documents. They are 
                starting points that you should review, customize, and ideally have checked by someone with 
                legal knowledge before sending.
            </p>

            <p>
                Semptify also provides reminders and organizational tools to help you stay on top of important 
                dates: when rent is due, when your lease expires, when deadlines are approaching. Small things, 
                but small things matter when life gets busy and stressful.

            <h2 class="section-title">What Semptify Does Not Do</h2>
            
            <p>
                Semptify does not provide legal advice. We cannot tell you what to do in your specific situation. 
                We cannot represent you in court. We cannot guarantee any outcome. The information provided in 
                this application is educational and general — it may not be current, complete, or applicable 
                to your specific circumstances. Laws vary dramatically between states, counties, and even cities. 
                What is true in Minnesota may not be true in Texas or California.
            </p>

            <p>
                Semptify does not store your documents on our servers. This is intentional and important, which 
                we will explain in a moment. Semptify does not sell your data, does not analyze your documents 
                for advertising purposes, and does not share your information with third parties. Your rental 
                situation is your business, not ours.
            </p>

            <h3>⚠️ Important Legal Notice</h3>
            <p>
                Nothing in Semptify constitutes legal advice. The information provided is educational only. 
                Your situation is unique, and laws vary by location. What you read here may not apply to you.
            </p>

                We give only one piece of legal advice, and we give it freely:

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Security, Privacy & Confidentiality</h2>
            
            <p>
                We understand that the documents you store in Semptify are deeply personal. Lease agreements, 
                financial records, photographs of your living space, communications about disputes — this is 
                sensitive information. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, 
                <span class="stat">over 1,800 data breaches</span> exposed more than 422 million records in 
                2022 alone. We designed Semptify with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your OAuth tokens — the credentials that allow Semptify to save files to your cloud storage — 
                are encrypted using <span class="stat">AES-GCM encryption</span>, the same authenticated 
                encryption standard used by financial institutions. These tokens are encrypted with a key 
                derived from your unique user identifier, meaning even if our database were compromised, 
                your credentials would be unreadable without your specific key.
            </p>

            <p>
                But encryption is only part of the story. The more fundamental protection is architectural: 
                your documents never touch our servers. They go directly from your device to your personal 
                cloud storage. We do not have a database of user files. We do not have backup copies of your 
                lease or your photos. There is simply nothing for hackers to steal from us because we do not 
                have your data.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    "The most secure data is data we never have. Your documents live in your cloud storage, 
                    under your control, in your account."

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.25rem;">AI That Can Run Locally</h3>

            <p>
                Semptify includes AI-powered features to help answer questions about tenant rights and assist 
                with understanding legal documents. Unlike many applications that only work with cloud-based 
                AI services, Semptify supports <span class="stat">Ollama</span> — which means the AI can run 
                entirely on your own computer if you choose. Your questions and documents never leave your 
                machine.
            </p>

            <p>
                For users who prefer cloud AI providers, Semptify also supports OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Groq. 
                The choice is yours. But having the option for fully local AI processing means that 
                privacy-conscious users are never forced to send sensitive information to external services.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary); margin: 2rem 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.25rem;">Court Document Preparation</h3>

            <p>
                Semptify can help you prepare documents for court — answers to complaints, motions, and 
                written responses. These documents are generated locally in your browser and saved directly 
                to your cloud storage as PDFs. According to the National Center for State Courts, 
                <span class="stat">76% of civil cases</span> involve at least one self-represented party, 
                and having properly formatted documents can make a meaningful difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                To be clear: Semptify does not file documents with courts on your behalf. It helps you prepare 
                them. You will still need to file documents yourself, either electronically through your 
                court's e-filing system or in person at the courthouse. What Semptify provides is help 
                creating those documents with the correct format and relevant information included.
            </p>

            <div class="important">
                <div class="important-title">🔒 Confidentiality Commitment</div>
                <p>
                    Everything you do in Semptify is confidential. We do not track which documents you upload, 
                    what you search for, or what letters you generate. We do not sell analytics about user 
                    behavior. We do not share information with landlords, property management companies, 
                    tenant screening services, or any third party. Your use of Semptify is your business alone.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Why You Provide Your Own Storage</h2>
            
            <p>
                When you use Semptify, you connect your own cloud storage — Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, 
                or Dropbox. Your documents are saved directly to your account, not to our servers. This might 
                seem unusual, but it is a deliberate choice rooted in our core principles.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, it means your documents truly belong to you. If Semptify disappeared tomorrow, you would 
                still have every file, every photo, every document safely in your own cloud storage. You are 
                not dependent on us. You are not locked in. Your data is yours.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, it means we cannot see your files. We do not have access to read your lease, look at 
                your photos, or browse your communications. The connection between Semptify and your cloud 
                storage allows you to save and retrieve files — it does not give us access to snoop through 
                your personal documents.
            </p>

            <p>
                Third, and practically speaking, it is how Semptify can remain free. Storing documents for 
                thousands of users would require expensive servers and infrastructure. By using storage you 
                already have, we avoid those costs entirely. There are no server bills to pass on to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach also means there is no traditional "sign up" process. No username to create, 
                no password to remember, no email verification to complete. Your cloud storage login is your 
                login. Simple, secure, and private.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Cost of Semptify</h2>
            
            <div class="cost-highlight">
                <div class="price">$0</div>
                <div class="label">Free. Forever. No exceptions.</div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Semptify is completely free. There are no premium tiers, no subscriptions, no "freemium" 
                limitations where the useful features are locked behind a paywall. Every feature is available 
                to everyone, always.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is not a marketing strategy. This is not "free for now until we build a user base." 
                This is a fundamental principle. The people who need a tool like Semptify the most are often 
                those who can least afford to pay for it. Housing instability and financial stress frequently 
                go hand in hand. Charging money for this tool would mean excluding the very people it is 
                designed to help.
            </p>

            <p>
                Semptify exists to help people, not to make money. That is not a slogan — it is the honest 
                truth about why this project exists. If you find it useful, that is the only payment we need.

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">A Promise About Advertising</h2>
            
            <div class="no-ads">
                <div class="no-ads-title">🚫 Semptify Will Never Display Advertisements</div>
                <p>
                    This is an absolute commitment. There will never be banner ads, sponsored content, 
                    "promoted" suggestions, or any form of advertising in Semptify. Ever. If you see 
                    ads on something claiming to be Semptify, it is not the real application — it is 
                    a fake or a scam. Report it and do not trust it with your information.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                We will never sell your attention. We will never monetize your stress. Advertising in an 
                application used by people facing housing crises would be, frankly, disgusting. Someone 
                worried about losing their home does not need to see ads for moving companies or payday loans. 
                We refuse to participate in that economy.

            <h2 class="section-title">Being Prepared</h2>
            
            <p>
                The philosophy behind Semptify is simple: preparation and knowledge can prevent many problems, 
                and when problems cannot be prevented, preparation makes them easier to handle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most tenant-landlord disputes do not start as emergencies. They start as small issues — a 
                repair request that gets ignored, a misunderstanding about lease terms, a disagreement about 
                what was said in a conversation. These small issues become big problems when they are not 
                documented, when agreements are not in writing, when one party's word is pitted against another's.
            </p>

            <p>
                By documenting your tenancy from the beginning — your move-in condition, your maintenance 
                requests, your payments, your communications — you create a record. That record protects you. 
                It turns "he said, she said" into "here is the email I sent on March 15th." It turns "I think 
                I paid" into "here is the receipt and the bank statement."
            </p>

            <p>
                We genuinely hope you never face an eviction, never have a security deposit dispute, never 
                deal with an unresponsive landlord or uninhabitable conditions. But if you do, you will not 
                be starting from zero. You will have your records. You will know your rights. You will be 
                prepared.
            </p>

                    Do not wait until there is a problem. Upload your lease. Log your move-in condition.
